what is Collison in java?

In Java, a "collision" typically refers to a situation that can occur in hash-based data structures like HashMap or 
HashSet when two or more distinct keys produce the same hash code.

Here's a brief explanation:

Hashing: In hash-based data structures, each key is mapped to an index in an array using a hash function. 
This hash function computes a hash code for each key, which determines the index where the key-value pair will be stored.
Collision: A collision occurs when two or more keys produce the same hash code. 
This can happen due to the finite range of hash codes (32-bit integer) and the potentially infinite number of keys.

Handling Collisions: There are several strategies to handle collisions in Java:
Separate Chaining: In this approach, each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list 
(or other data structure) of key-value pairs that hash to the same index. 
When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is added to the linked list associated with that index.
Open Addressing: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for an alternative 
location in the hash table. This may involve examining nearby locations until an empty slot is found.
Rehashing: If the load factor (ratio of elements to buckets) exceeds a certain threshold, 
the hash table is resized and rehashed to reduce collisions and maintain performance.
Collisions are an important consideration in designing and using hash-based data structures, as they can affect 
performance and correctness if not handled properly. Ensuring a good quality hash function and choosing an appropriate 
collision resolution strategy are crucial for efficient usage of hash-based collections in Java.
