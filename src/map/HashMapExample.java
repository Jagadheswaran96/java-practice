//	What is Map?
//	Map is not a child interface for collection hence it is not considered as a 
//		one of collection interface.
//	It represents the data in Key-value pair.
//	Duplicate keys are not allowed.
//	Duplicate values are allowed.

//What is HashMap?
//	HashMap is implementation class for Map interface.
//	Duplicate keys are not allowed but duplicate values are allowed.
//	Using a technique called hashing to store elements.
//	Only one null key is allowed.
//	Insertion order is not preserved as it is using hashing so we can't 
//		predict retrieval order the elements inserted.
//	Value can be fetched only using key.
//	It is not synchronized if it has to be used on multi-threading environment so it 
//		has to be synchronized explicitly.
//	Initial capacity is 16 and load factor is .75%
