//	What is TreeMap?
//			TreeMap is implementation class for Map interface.
//			The elements will be retrieved on natural sorting order.
//				It means that values will be fetched based on alphabetical order of key names.
//			Duplicate keys are not allowed but duplicate values are allowed.
//				It means that if there is same key names present then the value will be overridden with next one.
//			Using a technique called hashing to store elements.
//			Null key is not allowed.
//				Becoz it will throw nullpointexception since null can't be compared with key names as null is a keyword
//			Insertion order is not preserved as it is using hashing so we can't 
//				predict retrieval order the elements inserted.
//			Value can be fetched only using key.
//			It is not synchronized if it has to be used on multi-threading environment so it 
//				has to be synchronized explicitly.
//			Initial capacity is 16 and load factor is .75%
