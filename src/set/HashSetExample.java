//	Hashset class is implementation for Set interface.

//	Can insert heterogeneous objects like int, string if generics are not used.
//	Null elements are allowed.
//	Implements serializable and cloneable interfaces.
//		Serializable is nothing but changing the object to sharable in network
//	Data are stored based on hashcode so search operation is very efficient.
//	Fill ration or load factor is 0.75% or 75%.
//	Default capacity is 16
