//	TreeSet class is implementation for SortedSet, Comparable and NavigableSet interface.
//	Duplicate values are not allowed.
//	Elements will be retrieved on natural sorting order.
//	Insertion order is maintained.
//	Underlying DC is binary search tree.
//	Cannot insert heterogeneous objects like int.
//		Becoz int and string etc are diff data types so since it will return in natural sorting order
//		it will accept only one type of data type
//	Null elements are not allowed.
//	Implements serializable and cloneable interfaces.
//		Serializable is nothing but changing the object to sharable in network
//	Data are stored based on hashcode so search operation is very efficient.
//	Fill ration or load factor is 0.75% or 75%.
//	Default capacity is 16
